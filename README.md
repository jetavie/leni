# Addeneum

NOTE: Make sure you have created the role "Blacklisted" in your discord server. If you want to use a different name, refer to lines with:
```discord.js
const blacklistRole = interaction.guild.roles.cache.find(role => role.name === 'Blacklisted');
```
If you don't make these changes otherwise, you'll get this error:

`‚ùå Blacklisted role not found! Please create a role named "Blacklisted".`

This is also true for members with staff roles:

```discord.js
const staffRole = interaction.guild.roles.cache.find(role => role.name === 'Staff'); 
```
If you don't make these changes otherwise, you'll get this error too:

`‚ùå Staff role not found! Please create a role named "Staff"`
