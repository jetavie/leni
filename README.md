# Addeneum

NOTE: Make sure you have the role "Blacklisted" in your discord server. If you want to use a different name, refer to lines with:
```discord.js
const blacklistRole = interaction.guild.roles.cache.find(role => role.name === 'Blacklisted');
```
If you don't make these changes otherwise, you'll get this error:

`"Blacklist role not found."`

This is also true for members with staff roles:

```discord.js
const staffRole = interaction.guild.roles.cache.find(role => role.name === 'Staff'); 
```
If you don't make these changes otherwise, you'll get this error too:

`"‚ö†Ô∏è You reqiure elevated permissions to do this."`
